Simple tool to get all services from https://status.epicgames.com/ which are not operational</br>
i added this program to my system variables so i can simple use "epicstatus" in cmd, tutorials for adding stuff to system variable can be found on youtube </br></br>
please start the program with cmd if you didnt added it to your system variables because it only prints the results and closes the program then </br></br>
if you have any other questions or sugguestions just dm me on discord: singleplayertm
